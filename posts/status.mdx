description: "Some firefly species face threats due to habitat loss caused by urbanization, pollution, pesticide use, and artificial light, disrupting their mating behavior. Additionally, light pollution can interfere with their natural signaling and mating rituals. Certain species of fireflies are facing declines, and conservation efforts are being made to protect their habitats and reduce human-induced threats to ensure their survival."
