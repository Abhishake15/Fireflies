title: LIFE CYCLE
description: "The life cycle of a firefly consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The female firefly lays eggs in moist soil or vegetation. Upon hatching, the larvae, often called glowworms, feed on small insects, snails, or other invertebrates. The larvae typically spend several months to years in this stage before pupating. After pupation, they emerge as adults, engaging in the mating process and living for a few weeks to months, depending on the species."
